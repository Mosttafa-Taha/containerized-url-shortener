## Project Idea
A simple **URL Shortener** that lets you create short links and redirect back to the original ones.  
We also integrated monitoring with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track usage, errors, and performance.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Build the app and containerize it with Docker.  
- **Week 2:** Add custom Prometheus metrics (redirects, errors, latency).  
- **Week 3:** Visualize metrics in Grafana dashboards.  
- **Week 4:** Add alerts, persistence, and finalize the stack.
